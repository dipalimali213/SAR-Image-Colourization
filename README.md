# SAR-Image-Colourization
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery is widely used in remote sensing applications due to its ability to capture high-resolution images regardless of weather conditions or lighting. However, SAR images are monochromatic, making it difficult for human observers to interpret surface features intuitively.

# 🌍 SAR Image Colourization for Comprehensive Insight Using Deep Learning  

## 📌 Project Overview  
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery is widely used in remote sensing due to its ability to capture high-resolution images regardless of weather or lighting conditions. However, SAR images are monochromatic, making it difficult for human observers to interpret surface features intuitively. This project aims to develop a Deep Learning-based system that accurately colorizes grayscale SAR images, enhancing their interpretability for space-borne applications.

## 🏆 Problem Statement  
**Problem Statement ID:** 1733  
**Theme:** Space Technology  

## 📖 Abstract  
### **Description:**  
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery is rich in structural and textural information but lacks the intuitive appeal of color, which can provide more comprehensive insights for space-borne applications. SAR image colorization using Deep Learning (DL) models offers a transformative approach for enhancing the interpretability of monochromatic SAR image data.  

The project aims to develop an innovative solution to colorize grayscale SAR images for enhanced interpretation and analysis of feature targets. A novel DL model needs to be designed and trained using pairs of SAR and Optical images, minimizing a loss function that captures the difference between predicted and actual color images.  

The participants are challenged to create a DL system that can accurately predict and apply colors to SAR images, making surface features more distinguishable and interpretable.  

### **🚀 Challenge:**  
The challenges require innovative approaches in data pre-processing, DL model design, and evaluation methodologies to develop effective and reliable SAR image colorization solutions.
