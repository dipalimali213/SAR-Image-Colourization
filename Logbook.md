# üåà SAR Image Colourization for Enhanced Interpretation Using Deep Learning

## üìå Problem Statement & Objectives

### üîç Problem Statement
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery is widely used in remote sensing due to its ability to capture high-resolution data under any weather or lighting conditions. Despite its effectiveness, the grayscale nature of SAR images significantly limits intuitive human interpretation, especially for tasks that require visual insights such as disaster management, urban analysis, and environmental monitoring. Therefore, there is a need for a solution that can colorize these grayscale images to make them more visually interpretable.

### üéØ Objectives
- To design and implement a deep learning-based solution for colorizing grayscale SAR images.
- To enhance the interpretability and visual appeal of SAR imagery using paired optical data.
- To train and validate models capable of generating perceptually accurate colorized outputs.
- To demonstrate practical applications across various domains such as disaster management, defense, and urban planning.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Planning and Execution

### üìÖ Planning and Milestones
The project was carried out in a systematic and well-organized manner, with each phase dedicated to a specific aspect of the development process. The following milestones were defined to ensure the smooth progression of the project:

#### **Phase 1: Literature Review and Model Selection**
In this initial phase, the project focused on understanding the current methods used for image colorization and enhancement, particularly in the context of SAR imagery. The following activities were carried out:
- **Literature Review**: A thorough review of current research papers, articles, and case studies was conducted to identify best practices and gaps in existing SAR image colorization solutions.
- **Model Selection**: Based on the review, various deep learning architectures such as **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**, and **Transformers** were evaluated for their suitability to this problem. 
  - **CNNs**: Effective for spatial feature extraction and suitable for colorization tasks.
  - **GANs**: Ideal for generating high-quality images through the adversarial training process between a generator and discriminator.
  - **Transformers**: Explored for handling long-range dependencies and achieving better feature representation.

#### **Phase 2: Dataset Acquisition, Preprocessing, and Alignment**
This phase involved the collection and preparation of the necessary data for model training. Key steps included:
- **Dataset Acquisition**: A diverse set of paired **SAR images** and **optical images** was gathered, with the optical images serving as ground truth for training the colorization model.
- **Preprocessing**: The acquired dataset was preprocessed to ensure compatibility with the model, involving:
  - **Normalization**: Scaling pixel values between 0 and 1.
  - **Resizing**: Ensuring uniform image size and format for consistent input.
  - **Augmentation**: Data augmentation techniques like rotation, flipping, and scaling were applied to increase the training dataset and prevent overfitting.
- **Alignment**: Aligning SAR and optical images accurately was a key challenge due to the different origins of the two image types. Proper alignment was crucial to ensure accurate mapping during the colorization process.

#### **Phase 3: Model Development, Training, Testing, and Metric-based Evaluation**
This phase focused on the development, training, and evaluation of the deep learning model. Key activities included:
- **Model Development**: Based on the selected architectures, a deep learning model was built using CNNs and GANs. This hybrid approach utilized CNNs for feature extraction and GANs for generating high-quality colorized images.
- **Training**: The model was trained using backpropagation and gradient descent. Loss functions were monitored, and hyperparameters were adjusted to ensure the model learned to generate perceptually accurate colorized images.
- **Testing**: The model‚Äôs performance was evaluated on a separate test dataset to ensure generalization to unseen data.
- **Metric-based Evaluation**: Several metrics were used to assess image quality:
  - **SSIM (Structural Similarity Index Measure)**: Measures the similarity between the colorized image and ground truth.
  - **PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)**: Evaluates the quality by comparing the peak signal to the noise.
  - **Perceptual Loss**: Ensures visual appeal by considering human-perceived image quality.

#### **Phase 4: Final Optimization, Deployment Preparation, and Results Presentation**
In the final phase, the model was optimized, prepared for deployment, and results were presented:
- **Optimization**: Based on evaluation metrics, the model was fine-tuned to improve performance through hyperparameter adjustment and the application of advanced optimization techniques.
- **Deployment Preparation**: The model was prepared for deployment in real-world scenarios, ensuring it could handle new SAR data and generate colorized outputs in real-time.
- **Results Presentation**: The final results, including colorized images, evaluation metrics, and other insights, were presented. Visual comparisons of grayscale and colorized images highlighted the model‚Äôs effectiveness.
