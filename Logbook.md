# 🌈 SAR Image Colourization for Enhanced Interpretation Using Deep Learning

## 📌 Problem Statement & Objectives

### 🔍 Problem Statement
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery is widely used in remote sensing due to its ability to capture high-resolution data under any weather or lighting conditions. Despite its effectiveness, the grayscale nature of SAR images significantly limits intuitive human interpretation, especially for tasks that require visual insights such as disaster management, urban analysis, and environmental monitoring. Therefore, there is a need for a solution that can colorize these grayscale images to make them more visually interpretable.

### 🎯 Objectives
- To design and implement a deep learning-based solution for colorizing grayscale SAR images.
- To enhance the interpretability and visual appeal of SAR imagery using paired optical data.
- To train and validate models capable of generating perceptually accurate colorized outputs.
- To demonstrate practical applications across various domains such as disaster management, defense, and urban planning.
