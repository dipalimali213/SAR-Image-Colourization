# 🌈 SAR Image Colourization for Enhanced Interpretation Using Deep Learning

## 📌 Problem Statement & Objectives

### 🔍 Problem Statement

However, the grayscale nature of SAR images limits intuitive human interpretation, particularly for applications requiring visual insights such as disaster assessment, urban analysis, and environmental monitoring.

### 🎯 Objectives
- To design and implement a deep learning-based solution for colorizing grayscale SAR images.
- To enhance the interpretability and visual appeal of SAR imagery using paired optical data.
- To train and validate models capable of generating perceptually accurate colorized outputs.
- To demonstrate practical applications across domains like disaster management, defense, and urban planning.

## 🛠️ Project Planning and Execution

### 📅 Planning and Milestones
The project was carried out in a structured and well-planned manner, with each phase focusing on specific aspects of the development process. This ensured that progress was steady and aligned with the desired objectives. The following phases were defined to guide the project:

#### **Phase 1: Literature Review and Model Selection**
In this initial phase, the focus was on researching and understanding the existing methods used for image colorization and enhancement, particularly in the context of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery. Key activities included:
- **Literature Review**: We thoroughly reviewed current research papers, articles, and case studies to gather insights into the best practices for SAR image colorization. This helped in identifying gaps in the existing solutions and in determining the most promising methodologies.
- **Model Selection**: Based on the review, we evaluated different deep learning architectures such as **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**, and **Transformers**. These architectures were chosen due to their effectiveness in image processing tasks. 
  - **CNNs** are known for their powerful ability to extract spatial features in image data, making them ideal for tasks like colorization.
  - **GANs** offer the ability to generate high-quality images through a competitive process between a generator and a discriminator, leading to realistic and visually pleasing results.
  - **Transformers** were explored for their ability to handle long-range dependencies in image data and for their success in other image processing tasks.
  
  By comparing the strengths and weaknesses of these models, the team selected the most suitable architectures for the project.

#### **Phase 2: Dataset Acquisition, Preprocessing, and Alignment**
This phase involved collecting and preparing the data required for training the models. Specific steps included:
- **Dataset Acquisition**: We gathered a diverse set of **SAR images** along with their paired **optical images**. These paired images are essential because the optical images provide ground truth data that helps train the model to colorize the grayscale SAR images effectively.
- **Preprocessing**: The collected data was preprocessed to ensure compatibility with the model. This included steps like:
  - **Normalization**: Scaling the pixel values of the images to a standard range, typically between 0 and 1.
  - **Resizing**: Ensuring all images were of the same size and format to facilitate consistent input for the model.
  - **Augmentation**: Applying data augmentation techniques (e.g., rotation, flipping, scaling) to artificially increase the size of the training dataset and prevent overfitting.
- **Alignment**: One of the key challenges was to align the SAR and optical images accurately. Since SAR images and optical images come from different sources, aligning them properly in space and time was critical for ensuring that the colorization model could learn the correct mapping between grayscale and colorized images.

#### **Phase 3: Model Development, Training, Testing, and Metric-based Evaluation**
In this phase, we focused on building, training, and evaluating the deep learning model. Key tasks included:
- **Model Development**: Based on the architecture selected in Phase 1, we began building the deep learning models. This involved setting up neural networks, defining layers, and choosing activation functions. The model design incorporated both CNNs and GANs to combine the strengths of both approaches—CNNs for feature extraction and GANs for high-quality image generation.
- **Training**: With the preprocessed dataset, the model was trained using backpropagation and gradient descent techniques. During training, we monitored the loss function and adjusted parameters to ensure that the model learned to generate perceptually accurate colorized SAR images.
- **Testing**: After training, we evaluated the model’s performance on a separate test dataset to verify that it generalized well to new, unseen data.
- **Metric-based Evaluation**: Several metrics were used to assess the quality of the generated colorized images:
  - **SSIM (Structural Similarity Index Measure)**: Measures the similarity between the colorized image and the ground truth optical image. A higher SSIM score indicates that the colorization preserves structural details.
  - **PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)**: Measures the quality of the generated image by comparing the peak signal (maximum possible pixel value) to the noise (deviation from the original).
  - **Perceptual Loss**: This is used to ensure that the colorization is visually appealing by considering human-perceived image quality, rather than just pixel-wise accuracy.

#### **Phase 4: Final Optimization, Deployment Preparation, and Results Presentation**
The final phase focused on refining the model, preparing for deployment, and presenting the results:
- **Optimization**: Based on the evaluation metrics from Phase 3, the model was fine-tuned to improve its performance. This could involve adjusting hyperparameters, using more advanced optimization techniques, or revising the loss functions to better capture perceptual quality.
- **Deployment Preparation**: This phase involved preparing the model for deployment in real-world scenarios. We ensured that the model could handle new SAR image data from different domains, such as disaster management or urban planning, and generate colorized outputs in real-time if needed.
- **Results Presentation**: The final results, including the colorized images, evaluation metrics, and any other relevant insights, were presented. Visual aids, such as side-by-side comparisons of grayscale and colorized images, helped to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model.
